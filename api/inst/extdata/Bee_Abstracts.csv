These bees can be found across the western United States from April to July. 
Osmia californica ,California mason bee,"California mason bees are dark metallic blue bees. Their thorax is dark blue and has coarse dots, and their abdomens are dark metallic blue with a shiny appearance. Females have black hairs on their heads and thoraxes, while males have white hairs.

Osmia cyanella,cyan mason bee,"The cyan mason bee is a medium-sized metallic bee. They are a dark blue color and have short, sparse black hairs on their body. These bees nest in the ground using mud, giving them the name “mason bee”. This bee can be found along the west coast of the United States and Canada from April to July. "
Osmia densa,dense-haired mason bee,"Dense-haired mason bees are shiny and metallic, with a blue color with hints of purple and green. They have long, pale hairs all over their body. Males have longer antennae than females and more noticeable hairs on their face and thorax. Female bees carry pollen on the underside of their abdomen using a special group of hairs called scopa. These bees build their nests in wood or beetle burrows, often in wet meadows, montane chaparral, and mixed evergreen forests. They are located in western North America, from southern British Columbia to Baja California and east to the Rocky Mountains."
Osmia exigua,short mason bee,"The short mason bee is a small metallic green and blue bee. Females are primarily green in color with hints of blue, while males are primarily blue with hints of green. These bees have sparse white hairs along their face and thorax and females have dense black hairs on the underside of their abdomen for pollen collection. This bee can be found throughout the western United States from May to July."
Osmia lignaria,blue orchard bee,"The blue orchard bee has a deep metallic blue-green color. They have light-colored hairs on their face, thorax, and abdomen. Females carry pollen on the underside of their abdomen in a special group of hairs called a scopa. These bees live for four to eight weeks in early spring. Males emerge first, wait for the females to appear, and then mate. After mating, females build nests in preexisting cavities in wood or pithy plant stems. They use mud to create separate sections for each egg, laying female eggs at the back of the nest and male eggs toward the front. These bees are present from March through June and are widespread across North America."
Osmia montana,Montana mason bee,"Montana mason bees are dark black with a subtle blue shine. Their thorax and abdomen are dark with deep blue highlights and black hair. They have large heads and very long jaws. These bees build their nests in existing wooden cavities. Montana mason bees mainly collect pollen from plants in the Asteraceae family, which might be a way to avoid parasitic bees. They can be found from April to June, ranging from British Columbia to Baja and east to Colorado."
Osmia ribifloris,currant orchard bee,"Currant orchard bees are medium-sized bees with a metallic blue-green color and black hair. They have wide jaws and a blue-green head and thorax covered in black, upright hair. Their abdomens are blue-green and don’t have hair bands. Males are a lighter shade of blue-green than females. These bees nest in existing cavities like old wasp nests or bee hotels, using chewed-up plant material to block off their nests.

It prefers drier areas and can be seen from April to June."
Stelis montana,Montana cuckoo carder bee ,"The Montana cuckoo carder bee is a nest parasite of Osmia lignaria. This means that they lay their eggs in the nests of the other bees, so that their offspring can feed on their gathered pollen reserves. These bees are a dark midnight blue color with sparse, dark black hairs. They can be found throughout the western United States and southwestern Canada from May to July."
Tetraloniella pomonae,Pomona longhorn,"The Pomona longhorn bee has short, thick ochre-colored hair on its face and golden hair on its thorax.
